merhaba! i'm onur ata, a software engineer based in berlin. 

i've spent close to a decade building software at every level, from writing GPU shaders for Oculus Quest (the first one) to owning entire web products end-to-end.

working across layers taught me to have a holistic approach to software. i now design and maintain web products and make games.
